  You need to classify the following statements as True or False. The statements will be provided in either OWL Manchester Syntax or in a form of natural language question. 
  Follow strictly these guidelines:
  1. Respond with only True or False.
  2. Entities from different categories are not in a subclass relationship.
  3. Statements or question containing numerous entities are most probably False.
  4. Carefully analyze the statement or the question to ensure the accuracy of your classification.
  5. If you are unsure about the classification, respond with False.
